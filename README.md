## **Made in Python**
Using: **`import flask`**, **`SQLite3`**, **`SQL Alchemy`**, **`Jinja2`** and **`Bootstrap`**

This is heavily inspired from **Miguel Grinberg**'s book **Flask Web Development**.
* _Flask_ was used as the backend framework.
* _SQLite3_ database was used with _SQL Alchemy_ as the _ORM_.
* The front-end was written in _HTML5_ and _CSS_ with _Jinja2_ for the dynamic part which talks with Flask.
* _Bootstrap_ was used for UI elements.
